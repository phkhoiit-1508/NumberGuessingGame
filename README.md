# Number Guessing Game (C++)

A simple console-based number guessing game written in C++.
This project is created to practice basic programming concepts.

## Game Modes

### 1. Classic Mode
- Guess a random number between 1 and 100
- Unlimited attempts
- Feedback after each guess (too high / too low)

### 2. Limit Attempts Mode
- Choose difficulty:
  - Easy: 1–50 (10 attempts)
  - Medium: 1–100 (7 attempts)
  - Hard: 1–500 (9 attempts)
- Game ends when attempts run out

### 3. Computer Guessing Mode
- Player thinks of a number from 1 to 100
- Computer guesses using binary search
- Player responses:
  - `>` if the number is greater
  - `<` if the number is smaller
  - `=` if correct
